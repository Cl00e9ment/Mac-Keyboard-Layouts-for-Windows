<p>Since the 1980s, Macintosh computers have shipped with a keyboard layout that makes it relatively easy to type diacritics and other symbols through the use of the Option key. Windows only provides an <a href="http://tlt.its.psu.edu/suggestions/international/accents/codeint.html">“International”</a> layout with a very limited range of accents; strangely, using this layout makes the quotation mark and apostrophe keys completely unusable. I created two keyboard layouts to fix this situation: one duplicating the standard U.S. layout used on the Mac (also identical to the “Canadian English” keyboard layout), and another replicating the “U.S. Extended” keyboard layout introduced with Mac OS X. If you aren’t already accustomed to one, I would recommend starting with the U.S. Extended, which provides more accents and places some characters in more logical positions. The standard layout, however, provides access to a few mathematical symbols that some might find useful.</p>

<p>These layouts do not change the basic keyboard, and thus do not require changing any existing habits. For their use, refer to <a href="http://tlt.its.psu.edu/suggestions/international/accents/codemacext.html">Penn State University</a> or <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic537340.files/USExtended.pdf">Harvard</a> for the U.S. Extended layout, or <a href="http://tlt.its.psu.edu/suggestions/international/accents/codemac.html">Penn State’s page on the standard Mac layout</a>, substituting the AltGr (right Alt) key for the option key. The On-Screen Keyboard built in to Windows will also allow you to view most of combinations.</p>

<p>To install, unzip the downloaded file, and run the “setup.exe” program; the installer will automatically add the layout to the input menu. I’ve tested it on Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. Both layouts can be installed on a system simultaneously, and can be removed through the Control Panel.</p>

<p>The source file are in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665">Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator</a> format. These layouts were coded by hand, but should you wish to migrate another keyboard layout from the Mac to Windows, you now use a <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/03/on-keyboard-layouts.html">script made for this purpose by Adobe</a>.</p>
